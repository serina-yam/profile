      <description>We talked mainly about anime.
I feel that many of the teachers at RareJob are anime lovers.
We also talked about novels.
I talked about the book I read last year , &amp;ldquo;I am Yellow, White, and alittle Blue&amp;rdquo;, so I told her I had read that book.
But I thought it was a mistake to tell her this because this book is hard to explain.
The teacher told me that I could search and translate the book and explain it, so I managed to explain the story.</description>

      <description>Because the teacher spoke slowly, I was enjoyable lesson time with her.
She also pointed out mistakes along the way.
She told me about a video streaming site called viu.

      <description>I talked about dramas and movies, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk about details.
She told me I looked young. Like a college student, she said.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I have short bangs.</description>
