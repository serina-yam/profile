## What we talked about

We talked about traveling.

I told the tutor about my favorite place.  
Specifically, I told her that I like the Gaudi buildings in Spain.  
My favorite place is the Sagrada Familia.

## Impressions

I didn't communicate effectively today.   
There are likely two reasons for this.   
Firstly, she speaks a bit too quickly.   
Secondly, I slept for most of the day.   
I couldn't even speak Japanese well todayðŸ˜©
