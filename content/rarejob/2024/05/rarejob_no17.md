## What we talked about

We talked about traveling.

I told the tutor about my favorite place.  
Specifically, I told her that I like the Gaudi buildings in Spain.  
My favorite place is the Sagrada Familia.

## Impressions

I couldn't speak well today.  
There are probably two reasons for this.  
First, She speaks a little too quickly.  
Second, I slept most of the day.  
I couldn't even speak Japanese well todayðŸ˜©
