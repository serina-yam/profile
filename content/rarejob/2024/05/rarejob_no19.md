## What we talked about

We talked about Health and Lifestyle.

I talked the tutor about my favorite food, sukiyaki.   
"I like sukiyaki, but it's expensive so I don't eat it often.  
In the region where I was born and raised, there's a tradition of eating it during the New Year's holiday."  
(I wanted to say this, but I couldn't express it very well. However, she understood.)


## Impressions

She spoke slowly, so I can hear most of what she talk about.  
I think my English ability is in a state where I know the vocabulary and grammar, but I can't speak fluently.  
I hope to become more fluent in commonly used phrases during my three weeks in the philippines.
