## What we talked about

We talked about health and lifestyle.

I told my tutor that I like hamburgers,  
especially from my favorite restaurant, McDonald's.

She informed me about McDonald's in the Philippines.  
The Filet-O-Fish there is expensive;  
it costs five times more than a meat hamburger.  
And now it's not available.

I didn't know that.  
I thought it was interesting.


## Impressions

I can understand when someone speaks slowly and I know all the words.
