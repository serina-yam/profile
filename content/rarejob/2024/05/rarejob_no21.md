## What we talked about

We talked about my favorites.

I told My tutor I liked 7-Eleven smoothies.  
She asked me if I meant Slurpee?

Apparently, in the Philippines, there is a drink called Slurpee.  
I think Slurpee and smoothies are different drinks.


## Impressions

I asked chatGPT about the difference between Slurpee and smoothie.

"Slurpees in Filipino 7-Elevens are icy drinks with fruity or soda flavors.  
Meanwhile, Japanese 7-Elevens offer smoothies made from blended fruits or veggies for a healthy boost of vitamins.  
Slurpees are like snacks to chill with, 
while smoothies are all about getting your nutrients in an tasty sip!"
