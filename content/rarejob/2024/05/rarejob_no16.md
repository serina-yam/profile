## What we talked about

We talked about my favorites.

I toled her about my favorite movies.  
I said, "My favorite movies is the Harry Potter series."

She asked me which country's movies I liked and I told her that I also like Indian movies.

She also liked Indian movies, so we had a lot talk about.  
She told me her favorite Indian movies.  
- 3 Idiots
- Dangal
- PK
- Taare Zameen Par (Every child is special)

I have only watched "3 Idiots".  
I didn't know only "Dangal", but I know the other movies.  
I'll watch them again sometime.

## Impressions

I could go into more detail than before.  
Moreover, the use of prepositions has enriched the content that can be explained in a single sentence.
