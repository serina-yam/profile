## What we talked about

We talked about health and lifestyle.

I told my tutor that I like hamburgers.  

McDonald's in Japan offers a wide variety of original menue.  
Samurai Mac is a typical menu.  
Originally a limited-time menu, it became a regular menu item due to its popularity.

We also talked about Japanese sweet called sakura-mochi.  
It's my favorite.  
It's is sold in spring.

## Impressions

I keep using Japanese filler words, even though I don't want to.
