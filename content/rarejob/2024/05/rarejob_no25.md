## What we talked about

We talked about My favorites.

I told my tutor about my favorite sports, soccer and baseball.  
I wathced soccer on TV with my family when I was a child.  
I liked soccer, but I didn't like baseball when I was a child.  

I watched the WBC on TV last year.  
It was amaiging.  
So now I also like baseball.
