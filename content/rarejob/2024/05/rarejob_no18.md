## What we talked about

We talked about My favorites.

I told the tutor about my favorite drink, the smoothie.  
I bought a smoothie at 7-Eleven today and drink it.  
Actually, it was my first time trying it, and I found it delicious,  
so it's become my favorite.

## Impressions

She knew about 7-Eleven from TikTok, so I was suprised.  
She was fluent in Japanese, which futher surprised me.  

Today's lesson was fun.
