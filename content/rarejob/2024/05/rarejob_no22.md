## What we talked about

We talked about Health and Lifestyle.

I told my tutor about coffee.  
I make coffee every morning using a coffee machine and then I drink it.  
I drink only one cup of coffee per day.

## Impressions

To be honest, I'm starting to find it a bit of a hassle to write my diary after online English lessons, lol.

Today's tutor had great pronunciation,  
but speaking too fast made it challenging to understand.  
I understood about 60%, but the fast pace made it difficult to respond.
