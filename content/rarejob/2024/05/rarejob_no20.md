## What we talked about

We talked about Health and Lifestyle.

My tutor said she had curry udon last week and I told her that Marugame Seimen is famous in Japan.  
She knew about Marigame Seimen, so I was surprised.

She asked me the difference between udon and ramen, but I couldn't explane it well.

## Impressions

I'm not very good at giving responses.  
I get nervous and sweaty....  
But I'm going to try again tomorrow.
