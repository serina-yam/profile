We talked about my favorites.

She asked me what my favorite food was and I told her about donuts.  
My favorite donut shop is Mister Donut, I said.  
I was toled that there are four donut stores in the Philippines.  
- Dunkin' Donuts
- J.CO Donuts
- Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
- Mister Donut

I didn't know that.  
I have yet to try the donuts from Dunkin' Donuts and J.CO Donuts.  
So I would like to try them when I visit the Philippines.


We also talked about Korean dramas.  
She gave me two drama recommendations.
- Legend of the Blue Sea
- Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-joo

I have never watched either of them, so I marked them in Philmarks.
