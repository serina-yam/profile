We talked mainly about anime.  
I feel that many of the teachers at RareJob are anime lovers.

The teacher told me that I could search and translate the information and explain it, I was able to explain in more detail than usual.

## Things to improve

When I don't have words right away, I tend to say "uh" or "ah" in Japanese.  
I can't explain about the stories of anime and dramas.  
I am getting to be able to say about myself, but it is difficult to talk about something other than myself.
