We talked mainly about anime.  
I feel that many of the teachers at RareJob are anime lovers.

We also talked about novels.  
I talked about the book I read last year , "I am Yellow, White, and alittle Blue", so I told her I had read that book.  
But I thought it was a mistake to tell her this because this book is hard to explain.

The teacher told me that I could search and translate the book and explain it, so I managed to explain the story.  
Next time I would like to try to explain the synopsis again with something easier to explain.

## Things to improve

When I don't have words right away, I tend to say "uh" or "ah" in Japanese.  
I can't explain about the stories of anime and dramas.  
I am getting to be able to say about myself, but it is difficult to talk about something other than myself.
