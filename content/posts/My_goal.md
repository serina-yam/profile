I have something I want to do.  
I want to live and work abroad.

I think it is still difficult for me because my English is not good.  
It is difficult to say what I want to say in English.  
So, I have been studying English hard since this year.

I went to Cebu to study abroad, and I started taking online lessons.  
I believe my English skills will improve if I keep studying English.

I will strive to speak more English within two years.


I am currently studying the following:

- Vocabulary
- Online lessons (Callan Method)
- Online lessons (topic conversation)
- Pronunciation
