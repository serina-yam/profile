I chose the lesson of conversation question.  
My teacher was so kind and laughed a lot.

She is also like korean drama.  
She also watched korean drama called **What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?**.


## Things I wanted to say but couldn't
- I used to read a lot of books, but now I hardly read any.
- I often go to Yoyogi Park.  
There are many people enjoying picnics on the grass in that park.
