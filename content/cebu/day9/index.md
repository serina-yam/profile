The doctor gave me medicine, so I feel a little better.  

The teacher explained to me about the IELTS almost every day.  
I didn't know why... Should I take the IELTS?? ðŸ˜‚

I also talked about the exam with another teacher.  
I told him, "My TOEIC score is 540 points, but I need 700 points."  
He told me, "Your score will increase immediately!"

I'll take the TOEIC exam next week after I return to Japan.  
To be honest, I don't think I can get a high score.
