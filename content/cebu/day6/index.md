It was first weekend in Cebu.  
I had plans to go to Cebu City with my friends,  
but I got sick again,  so I couldnâ€™t go out.

I bought a throat lozenge at a grocery store, because I had a sore throat.  

This evening, I shared with Japanese people how to take classes and study English.  
I also thought it was important to have conversations with Japanese people.
