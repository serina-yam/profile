## Original
Today, I move to cebu from manila, and I arrived at the language school.

I talked with two new students.  
They are from Saudi Arabia.  
I haven't hear Saudi Arabia's accent, so it's difficult for me to understand what he say.

I ate dinner in school cafeteria.  
it's tasty.  
I felt relieved, because I was worry about the quality of the food.
