Many of my teachers were concerned about my health because I was absent yesterday afternoon.  
they are so kindðŸ˜­  
I fell better than yesterday, and I can eat something.

After class, I went dinner with my friends.  
We had pizza and donuts.

First time eating a donut from J.CO Donuts.  
It looks cute but is very sweet.
