## Original
Today, I move to cebu from manila, and I arrived at the language school.

I talked with two new students.  
They are from Saudi Arabia.  
I haven't hear Saudi Arabia's accent, so it's difficult for me to understand what he say.

I ate dinner in school cafeteria.  
it's tasty.  
I felt relieved, because I was worry about the quality of the food.

Today, I moved to Cebu from Manila and arrived at the language school.  

I talked with two new students.  
They are both from Saudi Arabia.  
I haven't heard the Saudi Arabian accent before,  
so it was difficult for me to understand what he says.  

I ate dinner in the school cafeteria.  
It was tasty.  
I felt relieved because I was worried about the quality of the food.
