Today is the first rainy day since I came here.  
I always feel sleepy when the weather is bad,  
so I was sleepy today.

I had Korean food for dinner with my friends🇰🇷🇯🇵.  
After that, we went to the photo space at my school and took some photos.  
It was fun.

I'm worried about my next job.  
This is the first time since I became an engineer that I've gone such a long time without studying programming😐
