Today is the first rainy day since I came here.  
I always feel sleepy when the weather is bad,  
so I was sleepy today.

I had Korean food for dinner with my friends.  
After that, we went to the photo space at my school and took some photos.  
It was fun.

I'm worried about my next job.  
This is the first time since I became an engineer that I've gone such a long time without studying programmingüòê
