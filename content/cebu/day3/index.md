I made more friends than yesterday, so Iâ€™m very happy.

I changed group lessons because it didn't suit me much.

Also, it was my first time attending a Callan Method lesson.  
It was suitable for me, and I enjoyed the atmosphere.

Today, I had two callan method classes, which is unusual because I had a makeup class.  
I was very tired.
