This week is my last week at the CIA.  
The time has gone by so fast.

Today, a teacher gave me a snack.  
I found my new favorite snack: Bread Stix.  
Itâ€™s similar to my favorite Japanese snack called Asparagus.  
I will definitely buy some to take back to Japan.

When I told my favorite teacher that I have a boyfriend at another school in Cebu, he made a video of himself joking around and pretending to be mad at my boyfriend.    
It made me laugh so muchðŸ˜‚
