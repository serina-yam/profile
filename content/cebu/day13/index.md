I went to Bohol Island with my boyfriend.  
I was able to see Tarsier, the world’s smallest primate.
It was so cute🤍

We had a buffet lunch on the ship.  
I had a relaxing time, and then I climbed Chocolate Hill.

When I met him last week, I wasn’t feeling well,  
so I was happy to see him this week when I was better.

When we were in Japan, we jokingly said, “Let’s go on a date at Jollibee!” lol.  
It was really fun to do.
