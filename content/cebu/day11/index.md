I'm almost completely better now.

The teacher assigned me homework.  
It's about writing about my friend.  

I'm still not good at making sentences in English.  
I can't think of any English words, 
and it's difficult to put together what I want to say.  
 
 I asked about 5 teachers which English-English dictionary they recommend, Merriam-Webster or Dictionary.com.  
As a result, many teachers recommended Merriam-Webster, so I'll use Merriam-Webster.  
However, I don't like using an English-English dictionary...
