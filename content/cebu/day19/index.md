Today is my last day at CIA.  
I attended the graduation ceremony and took a lot of pictures with my friends from Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Russia, and Japan.  

I went to a Filipino restaurant for dinner with my friends from Taiwan and Japan.  
I ate pumpkin cream pasta and lobsterðŸŽƒðŸ¦ž.  
It was tasty, and I saw a beautiful view.

It was really, really fun!  
Although I stayed at CIA for only three weeks,  
I made a lot of friends.  
I also talked with my teachers.  

I think I improved my English skills a little,  
so I want to keep studying English in Japan.  

I will start taking Callan Method classes at NativeCamp since I liked it.  

I didn't realize studying abroad in Cebu would be so fun.  
I have more memories to cherish.
